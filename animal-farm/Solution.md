## My solution
I have separated app into classes and used class auto-loader, which can be populated with new classes in future. I also decided to keep animals data in variables (in addition to file saving), so I can re-use it on statistics generation, this helped me to avoid file processing as much as possible, so the app should be quite fast on the smaller numbers of limits.
